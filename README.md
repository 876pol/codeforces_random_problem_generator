# Codeforces Random Problem Generator

A Chrome extension that uses the Codeforces API to filter problems based on their difficulties and tags, and then opens a random problem based on the search criteria.

To clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/876pol/codeforces_random_problem_generator.git
cd codeforces_random_problem_generator
```

The `src` folder can then be loaded as an unpacked extension in browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
